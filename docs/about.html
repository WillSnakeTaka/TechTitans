                    <p>Hi, my name is Chris. I am glad to be working with a team of skilled individuals to build this website for CTP's Cohort 10 Hackathon.</p>
                    <p>It has been quite a journey so far, and I can say that there is definitely a lot for me to learn. Given this 3-day stretch, I have gotten more comfortable using my newly developed web skills to help create this platform.</p>
                    <p>My experience at York, or rather CUNY in general, has been quite interesting. There is a lot of information within this organization, and it is hard to find exactly what you need when you are in need of something.</p>
                    <p>I remember when I first started attending York during lockdown, there was so much information I was missing, whether it be Financial Aid assistance, Metrocard assistance, etc. I would never have gotten my hands on these resources if it wasn't for people reaching out and providing me with the portals.</p>
                    <p>I think that this idea of a centralized hub for CUNY students alike is one that could serve a purpose for anyone given their specific needs. After all, assistance should be easy to come by, not hidden under thousands of links. Check out my socials below if you would like to know more about me!</p>

                <div class="text-box">
                    <p>Hi, I'm Quazi. I'm thrilled to be part of this innovative project for the CTP's Cohort 10 Hackathon.</p>
                    <p>The journey so far has been a real adventure, and I've learned a great deal. Over the course of these intense three days, I've been diving into my new web development skills and applying them to build something impactful.</p>
                    <p>My time at CUNY has been a mix of excitement and challenge. Navigating through the wealth of information available can sometimes feel overwhelming, especially when you're looking for specific resources like financial aid or campus services.</p>
                    <p>I believe creating a centralized hub for CUNY students is a fantastic idea. It could simplify access to essential resources, making assistance more straightforward and less buried under countless links.

    <p>Hi, my name is William. I am honored to be in this program and to work with my teammates.</p>
    <p>I've learned CSS formatting from them, as well as how to create a sidebar menu using W3 and various other resources. We also work on different projects simultaneously.</p>
    <p>Why do I think Ella Fitzgerald is relevant? I personally had a conflict with the Brooklyn College New Theater Union and its new coordinators.</p>
    <p>While I understand that they may not have intended harm, I felt gaslighted, and they used subtle suggestions to exclude my works which they think it is not suitable for audiances.</p>
    <p>The director of the program has also been sending ambiguous messages, either through the coordinator or in Zoom chat, in an attempt to gaslight me.</p>
    <p>However, I have also met great professors and received support from the Office of Accessibility, so I know I have various resources to turn to.</p>
    <p>As a result, I decided not to cooperate with the theater and chose not to participate in their "Diverse Festival."</p>
    <p>Fortunately, my professor was supportive and found an alternative way to restore my INC grade.</p>
    <p>During that time, I learned about the story of Ella Fitzgerald, and I felt sorry for her because she didn't have the resources she needed back then to confront unfair treatments.</p>
    <p>I feel deeply inspired by her story and want to promote it to raise awareness, so that more people can seek the necessary help to overcome their difficulties.</p>
