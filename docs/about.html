    <p>Hi, my name is William. I am honored to be in this program and to work with my teammates.</p>
    <p>I've learned CSS formatting from them, as well as how to create a sidebar menu using W3 and various other resources. We also work on different projects simultaneously.</p>
    <p>Why do I think Ella Fitzgerald is relevant? I personally had a conflict with the Brooklyn College New Theater Union and its new coordinators.</p>
    <p>While I understand that they may not have intended harm, I felt gaslighted, and they used subtle suggestions to exclude me.</p>
    <p>However, I have also met great professors and received support from the Office of Accessibility, so I know I have various resources to turn to.</p>
    <p>As a result, I decided not to cooperate with the theater and chose not to participate in their "Diverse Festival."</p>
    <p>Fortunately, my professor was supportive and found an alternative way to restore my INC grade.</p>
    <p>During that time, I learned about the story of Ella Fitzgerald, and I felt sorry for her because she didn't have the resources she needed back then.</p>
    <p>I feel very inspired by her story, and I want to promote it to raise awareness, so that more people can seek the necessary help.</p>
