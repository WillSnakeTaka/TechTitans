            <div class="text-box">
                <p>Hi, my name is Chris. I am glad to be working with a team of skilled individuals to build this website for CTP's Cohort 10 Hackathon.</p>
                <p>It has been quite a journey so far, and I can say that there is definitely a lot for me to learn. Given this 3-day stretch, I have gotten more comfortable using my newly developed web skills to help create this platform.</p>
                <p>My experience at York, or rather CUNY in general, has been quite interesting. There is a lot of information within this organization, and it is hard to find exactly what you need when you are in need of something.</p>
                <p>I remember when I first started attending York during lockdown, there was so much information I was missing, whether it be Financial Aid assistance, Metrocard assistance, etc. I would never have gotten my hands on these resources if it wasn't for people reaching out and providing me with the portals.</p>
                <p>I think that this idea of a centralized hub for CUNY students alike is one that could serve a purpose for anyone given their specific needs. After all, assistance should be easy to come by, not hidden under thousands of links. Check out my socials below if you would like to know more about me!</p>

                <p>Hello, I’m Quazi! I’m really excited to be part of the CTP's Cohort 10 Hackathon. This project has been an amazing opportunity for me to grow my web development skills and apply them in a real-world setting.</p>

                <p>The past few days have been intense but rewarding. I’ve learned a lot and have been working hard to use my new skills to build something useful. It’s been a great adventure seeing my efforts come together.</p>

                <p>My experience at CUNY has had its ups and downs. When I first started as a freshman, finding the right resources was really tough. I didn’t know who to ask for help or where to look, and searching for information online was often confusing and overwhelming.</p>

                <p>That’s why I believe creating a centralized hub for CUNY students is such a great idea. It can make finding important resources much easier and less stressful. I’m passionate about this project and would love to share more about it. Feel free to connect with me through my socials below!</p>

                <p>Hello! My name is Xin Lu I am honored to participate in the CTP Cohort 10 Hackathon, which is a brand new challenge for me!</p>
                <p>This week I attended various conferences both online and offline, met a lot of like-minded people and learned a lot!</p>
                <p>I've been trying to work on the AI training problem for the past few days but sadly failed but I'm learning a lot from it.</p>
                <p>I'm sure next time I'll be able to train a competent AI and add it to my next project.</p>

                <p>Hi, my name is William. I am honored to be in this program and to work with my teammates.</p>
                <p>I've learned CSS formatting from them, as well as how to create a sidebar menu using W3 and various other resources. We also work on different projects simultaneously.</p>
                <p>Why do I think Ella Fitzgerald is relevant? I personally had a conflict with the Brooklyn College New Theater Union and its new coordinators.</p>
                <p>While I understand that they may not have intended harm, I felt gaslighted, and they used subtle suggestions to exclude my works which they think it is not suitable for audiences.</p>
                <p>The director of the program has also been sending ambiguous messages, either through the coordinator or in Zoom chat, in an attempt to gaslight me.</p>
                <p>However, I have also met great professors and received support from the Office of Accessibility, so I know I have various resources to turn to.</p>
                <p>As a result, I decided not to cooperate with the theater and chose not to participate in their "Diverse Festival."</p>
                <p>Fortunately, my professor was supportive and found an alternative way to restore my INC grade.</p>
                <p>During that time, I learned about the story of Ella Fitzgerald, and I felt sorry for her because she didn't have the resources she needed back then to confront unfair treatments.</p>
                <p>I feel deeply inspired by her story and want to promote it to raise awareness, so that more people can seek the necessary help to overcome their difficulties.</p>
